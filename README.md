# 4-Element-Inset-Fed-Rectangular-Microstrip-Patch-Antenna-Array-at-2.4-GHz

A microstrip patch antenna is a type of planar antenna commonly used in wireless 
communication systems. It consists of a metallic patch on a grounded substrate and operates 
efficiently at microwave frequencies, including the 2.4 GHz band, widely used for Wi-Fi, 
Bluetooth, and other wireless protocols. 

When multiple patch elements are arranged in an array configuration, the antenna's 
performance is significantly enhanced in terms of gain, directivity, and radiation pattern 
control. The inset-fed design improves impedance matching, ensuring optimal power transfer. 
The 4-element array design aims to achieve higher gain while maintaining compact size and 
efficiency, making it suitable for modern communication systems.
